1. First, visit the MetaMask website at metamask.io.

2. Click the "Get Chrome Extension" button, or "Get Firefox Extension" if you use Firefox.

3. Follow the instructions for adding the extension to your browser.

4. Once installed, click the MetaMask icon in your browser to launch it.

5. You'll be prompted to create a new account or import an existing one. Follow the prompts to create your account.

6. Set a strong password and backup your seed phrase. This phrase is important because it's the only way to recover your account if you lose your password or if your computer crashes.

7. You'll also be asked to confirm that you've backed up your seed phrase by entering it in the correct order.

8. Finally, you're all set! You can now use MetaMask to interact with Ethereum-based dApps and store your ETH and ERC-20 tokens securely, but you will need to change to MATIC network to interact with SUGovern.
